# TGPA
This is my Data Analysis and Design project
I've created a simple application that takes in the student's ID and sums up his/her overall percentage using an average algorithm
Once the we have the student's overall percentage, we will now loop over all the other courses to get their average.
Then we compare the both averages and if the Student's average is higher than a grade then we wouldn't show that course for the student to take during this semester

<h1>MAIN OBJECTIVE</h1>
We want the student to acheive a high GPA without them being scared if the courses during the semester are hard or not
